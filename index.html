						<p>Wells Verne (WVHG) started in a small office by five partners in New York City back in 2009.</p>
						<p>Having witnessed firsthand the dangers of overspeculation following the financial market crash of 2008, Wells Verne was born from a simple investment philosophy.</p>
						<p>We would always look towards a company's core fundamentals and seek to invest in companies that serve communities that will always need their products/services. Recession or not. We would also always seek to invest in companies that we believe grow responsibly and ethically.</p>
						<p>Over just a decade, this simple idea took $3m of privately-raised capital and slowly turned it into a $44m-a-year business behemoth.</p>
						<p>We continue to seek new investment opportunities wherever they come. If you believe you have such an opportunity for us, you may contact us <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
						<p>We're also always looking for new faces and new talents. If you'd like to work at Wells Verne, you may send a copy of your resume and CV to careers@wellsverne.com</p>

						<p>As investors, we always like to think ahead. Over the past two years, we've undertaken great initiatives to invest in specifically two new industries that we're very excited about.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="subtitle">On renewable energy</p>
						<p>We believe in living sustainably and helping build societies that have a low carbon footprint. Over the next 10 years, we plan on investing over $250m in companies that are building the infrastructure needed to serve residents in New York City and Philadelphia with renewable energy.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="subtitle">On artificial intelligence</p>
						<p>Artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting new industries of our time and we regularly seek out companies that are working to create AI chips for data centers and smartphones as well as integrating AI into products that their customers already use. To date, we have invested over $19m into AI and we have no plans of slowing down.</p>
